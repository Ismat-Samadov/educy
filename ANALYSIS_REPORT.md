---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. **Case Room Enrollment Bypass Vulnerability**
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** `/app/api/case-rooms/[id]/posts/route.ts:83-124`

**Problem:** The GET endpoint for retrieving case room posts does NOT verify that the requesting user is enrolled in the associated section. Any authenticated user can view posts from any case room.

**Impact:**
- IDOR vulnerability - students can access discussions from courses they're not enrolled in
- Privacy violation - unauthorized access to student discussions
- Potential data leak

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Add before line 100
const room = await prisma.caseRoom.findUnique({
  where: { id: params.id },
  include: { section: true },
})

if (!room) {
  return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: 'Room not found' }, { status: 404 })
}

// Check enrollment for students
if (session.user.role === 'STUDENT') {
  const enrollment = await prisma.enrollment.findFirst({
    where: {
      userId: session.user.id,
      sectionId: room.sectionId,
      status: 'ENROLLED',
    },
  })

  if (!enrollment) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { success: false, error: 'Not enrolled in this course' },
      { status: 403 }
    )
  }
}
```

---

### 2. **Missing CSRF Protection**
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** All state-changing API endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE)

**Problem:** While NextAuth configures CSRF tokens, there's no validation middleware on API routes. This exposes the application to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

**Impact:**
- Attackers can trick users into performing unwanted actions
- Unauthorized enrollment/unenrollment
- Grade manipulation
- Course deletion

**Fix Required:**
1. Implement CSRF token validation middleware
2. Apply to all POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH endpoints
3. Validate tokens in API routes

---

### 3. **File Ownership Validation Missing in Case Posts**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `/app/api/case-rooms/[id]/posts/route.ts:50-56`

**Problem:** When students create case room posts with attached files, there's no validation that they own the referenced file keys.

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const post = await prisma.casePost.create({
  data: {
    roomId: params.id,
    studentId: session.user.id,
    content: data.content,
    fileKeys: data.fileKeys, // No ownership validation!
  },
})
```

**Impact:** Students could reference files owned by other users in their posts.

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Validate file ownership before creating post
if (data.fileKeys && data.fileKeys.length > 0) {
  const files = await prisma.file.findMany({
    where: {
      key: { in: data.fileKeys },
      ownerId: session.user.id,
    },
  })

  if (files.length !== data.fileKeys.length) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { success: false, error: 'Invalid file references - you can only attach your own files' },
      { status: 403 }
    )
  }
}
```

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. **Debug Endpoints Enabled in Production**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `/app/api/debug/**`

**Problem:** Debug endpoints (`/api/debug/env-check`, `/api/debug/test-email`, `/api/debug/enrollments`) can be enabled in production via environment variable.

**Impact:**
- Information disclosure
- Potential security misconfiguration
- Environment variable exposure

**Fix:** Remove debug endpoints entirely or gate behind build-time flag, not runtime environment variable.

---

### 5. **Missing Rate Limiting on Critical Operations**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Multiple endpoints

**Problem:** Rate limiting only exists on authentication endpoints. Critical operations are unprotected:
- Certificate issuance (`/api/certificates/issue`)
- Grade submission (`/api/submissions/[id]/grade`)
- Enrollment approvals/rejections
- Payment recording
- User import

**Impact:**
- Resource exhaustion
- Denial of service
- Abuse of system features

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/certificates/issue/route.ts`
- `/api/submissions/[id]/grade/route.ts`
- `/api/enrollments/[id]/approve/route.ts`
- `/api/enrollments/[id]/reject/route.ts`
- `/api/payments/route.ts`
- `/api/admin/users/import/route.ts`

---

### 6. **Payment Student ID Validation Missing**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `/app/api/payments/route.ts:23-56`

**Problem:** POST endpoint doesn't verify that `studentId` refers to an actual student.

**Impact:**
- Payments can be recorded for non-existent users
- Payments can be assigned to instructors or admins
- Data integrity issues

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Add after parsing data
const student = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: data.studentId },
})

if (!student || student.role !== 'STUDENT') {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: false, error: 'Invalid student ID' },
    { status: 400 }
  )
}
```

---

### 7. **File Upload Size Validation Inconsistency**
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Location:** `/app/api/files/upload-url/route.ts:14, 34-39`

**Problem:** File size validation uses client-provided `maxSizeBytes` with only a default of 10MB.

**Issue:**
```typescript
maxSizeBytes: z.number().positive().optional().default(10485760), // Client can override!
```

**Impact:**
- Clients can specify their own size limits
- Potential for extremely large file uploads
- Storage abuse

**Fix:** Enforce server-side maximum regardless of client input.

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 8. **Weak Password Complexity Requirements**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:74-81`

**Current Requirements:**
- 8+ characters
- 1 uppercase
- 1 lowercase
- 1 number

**Missing:**
- Special characters
- Minimum length should be 12+
- No check against common passwords

**Recommendation:** Use zxcvbn or similar library for entropy-based validation.

---

### 9. **No Failed Login Attempt Tracking**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `/lib/auth.ts:74-87`

**Problem:** Failed login attempts are not logged in audit logs.

**Impact:**
- Cannot detect brute force attacks
- No visibility into unauthorized access attempts
- Difficult to identify compromised accounts

---

### 10. **Session Duration Too Long for Privileged Roles**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `/lib/auth.ts:109-116`

**Current:** 24-hour session for all roles

**Recommendation:**
- Admin/Instructor: 4-8 hours
- Student: 24 hours
- Implement "remember me" option

---

### 11. **Missing Input Validation on Course Code Uniqueness**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `/app/api/courses/[id]/route.ts:134-147`

**Problem:** PUT endpoint allows updating course code but doesn't check for uniqueness before update.

**Impact:** Database constraint violation errors instead of user-friendly validation.

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY / IMPROVEMENTS

### 12. **UI/UX Inconsistencies**

**Button Component Not Used Consistently:**
- `/components/ui/button.tsx` exists but many pages still use raw `<button>` tags
- **Affected:** Course actions, leave course, enrollment buttons
- **Recommendation:** Refactor to use Button component throughout

**Loading States:**
- Some pages show "Loading..." text only
- Others have skeleton loaders
- **Recommendation:** Standardize loading UX

**Error Handling:**
- Mix of `alert()` and toast notifications
- **Recommendation:** Implement consistent toast notification system

---

### 13. **Missing Delete Confirmation for CourseActions**
**Location:** `/components/course-actions.tsx:72-78`

**Current:** Uses browser `confirm()` dialog
**Better:** Custom modal with detailed information about what will be deleted

---

### 14. **Accessibility Issues**

- **Missing ARIA labels** on icon-only buttons
- **Color contrast** may not meet WCAG AA standards in some areas
- **Keyboard navigation** not tested for all interactive elements
- **Screen reader** support for dynamic content updates

---

### 15. **Performance Considerations**

**N+1 Query Potential:**
- Course listing with enrollments count
- Student assignments with submission status
- **Recommendation:** Review and optimize with Prisma includes

**Missing Pagination:**
- Course listings load all courses
- Assignment listings load all assignments
- **Recommendation:** Implement cursor-based pagination

**No Caching Strategy:**
- Static course data fetched on every request
- **Recommendation:** Implement SWR or React Query
