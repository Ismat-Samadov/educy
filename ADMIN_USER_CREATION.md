# Admin-Managed User Registration

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your platform now uses **Admin/Moderator-Managed Registration** instead of public sign-up. This is perfect for a premium data science course model.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Public Registration Disabled ❌
**File: `/auth/register`**

**File: `app/page.tsx`**
- Removed "Get Started" / "Sign Up" buttons
- Changed to "Sign In to Your Account"

### 3. Admin User Creation System ✅
**New Pages:**
- `/admin/users` - View all users, now with "Create User" button
- `/admin/users/create` - Form to create new users

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/admin/users` - Create user with auto-generated password
- Returns temporary password for admin to share

### 4. Welcome Email System 📧
**File: `lib/email.ts`**
- Professional welcome email template
- Includes login credentials
- Reminds user to change password
- Auto-sent when admin creates user

4. **Student Receives Email**
   ```
   Subject: Welcome to Educy - Your Account Credentials
