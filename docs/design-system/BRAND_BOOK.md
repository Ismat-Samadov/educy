## Typography System

### Font Strategy

**Philosophy:** Clarity over creativity. Education demands readability.

**System Font Stack:**
We use system fonts for optimal performance and native feel:

```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
```

**Why system fonts:**
- **Performance** - No download time, instant rendering
- **Familiarity** - Users are comfortable with system fonts
- **Accessibility** - Optimized for screen reading
- **Cross-platform** - Looks native on all devices

## Visual Style

### Design Principles

#### 1. Clarity First
- Information should be immediately understandable
- Remove unnecessary elements
- Use white space generously
- One primary action per screen

#### 2. Consistency
- Reuse patterns and components
- Maintain spacing scale (4px increments)
- Keep border radius consistent (12px = rounded-xl)
- Use established color palette only

#### 3. Modern Minimalism
- Clean, uncluttered interfaces
- Purposeful use of color
- Subtle shadows and depth
- Smooth transitions and animations

#### 4. Mobile-First Responsive
- Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px)
- Readable text at all sizes
- Flexible layouts that adapt gracefully

### Visual Elements

#### Shadows
```tsx
// Card shadow
className="shadow"         // Soft: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)

// Elevated shadow
className="shadow-lg"      // Medium: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)

// Floating shadow
className="shadow-xl"      // Strong: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)

// Hover lift
className="shadow hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow duration-300"
```

#### Border Radius
```tsx
// Standard radius (USE THIS)
className="rounded-xl"     // 12px - buttons, inputs, cards

// Large radius
className="rounded-2xl"    // 16px - large cards, hero sections

// Full radius
className="rounded-full"   // Circles, pills, avatars
```

**Consistency Rule:** Always use `rounded-xl` unless there's a specific design reason for another value.

#### Spacing Scale
Use Tailwind's 4px increment scale:
```tsx
p-2  = 8px
p-4  = 16px
p-6  = 24px  ← Common for cards
p-8  = 32px
p-12 = 48px
```

**Standard Patterns:**
- Card padding: `p-6`
- Section spacing: `space-y-6`
- Form field gap: `gap-4`
- Button padding: `px-6 py-3`

#### Transitions
All interactive elements should have smooth transitions:
```tsx
className="transition"                    // All properties
className="transition-colors duration-200" // Color changes
className="transition-shadow duration-300" // Shadow changes
```

## Voice & Tone

### Writing Style

2. **Helpful & Instructive**

```

```

#### Helper Text
