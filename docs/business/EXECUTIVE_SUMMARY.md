# Educy: Executive Summary
## Complete Course Management for Offline & Onsite Education

**One-Page Overview for Course Owners & Training Center Decision-Makers**

---

## The Problem

**Your team spends 70% of their time coordinating instead of teaching.**

- Enrollment requests lost in email chaos
- Room scheduling conflicts waste time and money
- Manual spreadsheets cause errors and overselling
- Students claim "I didn't get the email" or "I didn't know the location"
- No audit trail for compliance and dispute resolution
- Administrative overhead prevents scaling

**Cost:** Institution with 20 instructors and 500 students loses **$50,000-100,000 annually** in wasted staff time and errors.

---

## The Solution

**Educy: Digital course management platform specifically designed for offline/onsite education delivery.**

Replaces spreadsheets, email coordination, and paper processes with an integrated system that:
- ✅ Automates enrollment requests with capacity enforcement
- ✅ Prevents room scheduling conflicts (100% elimination)
- ✅ Manages assignment submission and grading workflows
- ✅ Provides dual-channel notifications (in-app + email)
- ✅ Maintains complete audit trail for compliance
- ✅ Delivers weekly timetables to students (know where to go, when)

**Unlike generic LMS (Moodle, Canvas):** Educy is purpose-built for physical classroom management, not online learning.
