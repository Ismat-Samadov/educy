# SLIDE 2: The Problem We Solve

## Running Courses Today is Broken

### Current Reality for Course Owners:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Enrollment Chaos** | Hours spent managing spreadsheets, lost emails, duplicate entries |
| **Assignment Nightmare** | Files scattered across emails, no tracking, version confusion |
| **Schedule Conflicts** | Manual room booking, double-bookings, communication gaps |
| **Zero Visibility** | No real-time insights, struggling students slip through cracks |
| **Paper-Based Processes** | Attendance sheets, grade books, manual reporting |

### The Cost of Manual Operations:

- **15+ hours/week** spent on administrative tasks per instructor
- **30% of enrollment requests** get lost or delayed
- **No early warning system** for at-risk students
- **Scaling is impossible** without hiring more admin staff

> *"I spend more time on paperwork than actually teaching."* - Every Course Owner Ever
