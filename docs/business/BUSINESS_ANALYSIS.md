## Executive Summary

### Product Overview

**Educy** is a comprehensive course management platform specifically designed for **offline and onsite educational delivery**. Unlike generic Learning Management Systems (LMS) built for online education, Educy addresses the unique operational challenges of physical classroom management.

**Core Value:** Automates administrative workflows, eliminates manual coordination errors, and provides complete operational visibility for training centers, bootcamps, trade schools, and small educational institutions.

### Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
- Global corporate training market: **$370 billion (2024)**
- Onsite/in-person training segment: **~40% = $148 billion**
- Software-addressable portion (small-medium institutions): **~5% = $7.4 billion**

**Target Market:** 50,000-100,000 institutions worldwide operating in the "manual gap" between spreadsheets and enterprise systems.

### Unique Positioning

**The Manual Gap:**
```
Small Institutions          Educy Sweet Spot        Enterprise
(50-500 students)          (500-2,000 students)    (2,000+ students)
      ↓                           ↓                        ↓
Spreadsheets/Email  →   Professional System   ←   SAP/Oracle/Ellucian
$0/year, chaos             $5,000-20,000/year        $50,000-500,000/year
No features                 Core features             Complex features
```

**Differentiation:** 80% of enterprise features at 1% of the cost with 10% of the complexity.

### Business Model

**Primary Revenue:** SaaS subscription based on active users or courses
- **Pricing:** $5-20 per active user/month or $500-2,000 per institution/semester
- **Target Customer:** Training centers with 100-1,000 students
- **Average Contract Value (ACV):** $6,000-20,000 annually

**Customer Acquisition:**
- **CAC (estimated):** $2,000-5,000 per customer (content marketing + demo)
- **LTV (estimated):** $30,000-100,000 (5-year retention)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 6:1 to 20:1 (healthy SaaS economics)

### Key Success Factors

1. **Proven ROI:** Customers see $400,000-600,000 value in year 1 from time savings alone
2. **Low Implementation Barrier:** 25-30 hours setup, 4 weeks to full operation
